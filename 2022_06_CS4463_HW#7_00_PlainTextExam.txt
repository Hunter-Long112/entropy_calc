	B

   2.d. (  0.5 pts) Authentication.  Enter a single letter.
	A

3. (  0.5 pts) List one attack type on watermarking.
	Multiple Watermarking

4. (  1.0 pts) I have created an image I wanted to digitally protect, so I have it watermarked with a sophisticated algorithm. I post it on a website believing it's secure, that if anyone decides to use it, I can prove it's mine. However, when I happened across the same image on another website, I couldn't prove it was mine because they used a mosaic attack. Briefly describe what the adversarial website did to post my image and negate my watermark.
	They cut your image up into pieces, and then reassembled them in a way that is not technically the originally image, but is indistinguishable to the human eye from the original image.
